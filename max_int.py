# Program that finds the maximum positive integer input by a user. 
# The user repeatedly inputs numbers until a negative value is entered.

# Get two inputs from user to start the loop

# While the user enters positive values, compare the two values
# and keep the larger one. Then ask for a new one

# As soon as the input is negative, exit the loop and print the maximum
