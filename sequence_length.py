# Program that generates the first n numbers in the sequence:; 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, ...
# Each number is the sum of the three numbers before.

n = int(input("Enter the length of the sequence: "))

# Initialize the values that will be summed up in the loop, and a counter

# Run a loop that prints n sums of three integers, updating the integers
